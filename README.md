# flex-box-introduction
In this training project I got acquainted with flex box, SCSS and program collector, compiler - Prepros

# At first. Create a clone of the project
In Git CMD , specify the path to the folder where you want to clone the project . Then enter the command :                                             
clone git https://github.com/rojinald/flex-box-introduction.git

The second step.
In Prepros, open the project, go to the folder .../#source/css/style.css and on the right in the OUTPUT FILE column specify the path to .../css/style.css

Congratulations, now you can work with SCSS and the Prepros program will compile it into CSS :)
